= Spring Boot Testsuite

== Instructions

Steps to execute the test suite are:

1) Login to Open Shift
----
oc login $(minishift console --url) -u admin -p admin
----

2) Grant permissions for config map, circuit-breaker
----
oc policy add-role-to-user view -n $(oc project -q) -z default
----

3) Execute tests
----
mvn clean verify -Popenshift
----

== Use cases to be investigated

* Health Check (OpenShift+Spring Boot Actuator)
* Kubernetes ConfigMap for configuration

* Server-side load balancing (Kube/OpenShift).
* Kubernetes/DNS for service registration/discovery (+ ribbon backed by Kube with one IP?)
  If multiple endpoints are registered, they will be used for loadbalancing by ribbon (https://github.com/fabric8io/spring-cloud-kubernetes#ribbon-discovery-in-kubernetes)

* Hystrix + Turbine Server to stream info reported by the Services Circuit Checked (= Hystrix Circuit Breaker pattern)
* Logging (EFK)

== Future version of Obsidian.next

* Zipkin (https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-zipkin) till Hawkular (APM) + CloudForms are ready / https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-sleuth/
* Zuul : On OpenShift : APi Manager + Apiman Gateway should be the way to go

== REST Service with Apache Tomcat

* Component : https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/master/spring-boot-starters/spring-boot-starter-web[Spring Boot Starter Web], https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/master/spring-boot-starters/spring-boot-starter-tomcat[Spring Boot Starter Web Tomcat]
* Framework : Spring Web, Spring Web MVC
* Container : Apache Tomcat

**Description**

A REST endpoint is exposed by Spring Boot using as Java Web Container Apache Tomcat. The REST endpoint `/greeting` returns a message to say hello world with an id which is increment
for each call.

----
http http://localhost:8080/greeting
HTTP/1.1 200
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
Date: Thu, 23 Feb 2017 08:11:08 GMT
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

{
    "content": "Hello, World!",
    "id": 1
}
----

== REST Service using Apache CXF

* Component : https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/master/spring-boot-starters/spring-boot-starter-tomcat[Spring Boot Starter Web Tomcat]
* Framework : Apache CXF - 3.1.10
* Container : Apache Tomcat

This use case is based on the same logic as `REST Service with Apache Tomcat` but it uses as starter `Spring Boot Starter - Apache CXF`. To let
Apache CXF to discover the services and register the REST application, the property `cxf -> jaxrs` has been added within the `application.properties`
file in order to tell to the framework to discover and register the REST endpoints

----

  jaxrs:
    component-scan: true

== JPA with Spring Data repositories

* Component: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/master/spring-boot-starters/spring-boot-starter-data-jpa[Spring Boot Starter Data JPA] and https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/master/spring-boot-starters/spring-boot-starter-data-rest[Spring Boot Starter Data Rest].
* Framework: Hibernate

**Description**

The goal of this use case is to setup a CRUD service talking to a H2 database where the model is defined with the common entities https://github.com/obsidian-toaster/springboot-testsuite/tree/master/common/src/main/java/org/jboss/snowdrop/common/domain[here].
At run time, an in memory H2 database is created, some records imported using an import.sql file.
The CRUD services will be generated automatically.

== JPA with Hibernate

* Component: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/master/spring-boot-starters/spring-boot-starter-data-jpa[Spring Boot Starter Data JPA].
* Framework: Hibernate

The goal of this use case is to setup a CRUD service talking to a H2 database where the model is defined with the common entities https://github.com/obsidian-toaster/springboot-testsuite/tree/master/common/src/main/java/org/jboss/snowdrop/common/domain[here].
At run time, an in memory H2 database is created, some records imported using an import.sql file.
A Service class will contain the CRUD methods. No transaction support is required.

== Health Check

* Component: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/master/spring-boot-starters/spring-boot-starter-actuator[Spring Boot Starter Actuator]

The goal of this use case is to verify health endpoint exposed by the Spring Boot Actuator. In a local test case healthy and unhealthy statuses are verified using a custom health indicator.
In an OpenShift test case only healthy status is verified, because otherwise pod wouldn't start or would be restarted.

== Ribbon

* Component: https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-netflix/tree/master/spring-cloud-starter-ribbon[Spring Cloud Starter Ribbon]
* Framework: Netflix Ribbon, Fabric8 Spring Cloud Kubernetes

== Circuit Breaker

* Hystrix

= Obsidian.Next

== Tracing

* Component: https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-sleuth[Sleuth]
* Framework: Zipkin
